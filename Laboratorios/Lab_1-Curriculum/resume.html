						I'm a digital systems and robotics student that is passionate for living new experiences and learning
						new things in the process. I find computer science as my passion and I'm eager to improve my skills every

								<h4>
									Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) CLI migration
								</h4>
								<p>
									Facebook’s data center’s switches run over an operative
									system called fboss. This OS counts with interfaces developed in
									python that support data display from the routing protocols they
									use. For this project, I migrated 18 BGP commands developed in
									fboss to fboss2, a faster version of fboss that decreased response
									time of each command by seven times. This migration consisted
									in the modulation and implementation of each command in a C++
									developed interface, as well as writing unit tests for the execution
									of each command.

								<h4>
									Server-side batching API for database operations
								</h4>
								<p>
									Ad’s data is constantly being saved by inner teams to Google’s
									database F1. The write operation to this database happens with a
									synchronous server call where the latency takes the whole write
									operation to the database. I oversaw the implementation of an API
									that allowed asynchronous requests by performing batching on
									the server side, reducing the latency of the call, and improving the
									performance of the database write operations.
								</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<h4>
									Server-side batching Injection Tool
								</h4>
								<p>
									I wrote a main C++ file that can send requests to the server-side batching
									API to measure its efficiency and batching operations. This tool can read and
									write data from F1 to make sure the pre-requisite data is present in the tables
									and then it performs an RPC request to the server with each individual row
									update to test batching efficiency.

								<h4>
									Full Stack Web Portfolio
								</h4>
								<p>
									As a starter project for the internship, I developed my own web
									portfolio, where I added information about myself and the projects
									I've worked in. The project was used to learn the basics of full
									stack development, test-driven development and unit testing on
									back-end operations.

								<h4>
									Web Application for Street Vendors
								</h4>
								<p>
									Covid-19 affected many businesses worldwide with mandatory
									lockdowns in some countries. I actively participated on the
									development of a web application focused on connecting street
									vendors with clients within a certain radius as an assist to
									advertise their business during the pandemic where the
									movement on the streets was reduced at its lowest point. I
									oversaw handling the user and vendor authentication and
									registration to use the app as well as adding the home view,
									tutorial, and navigation bar of the web page.
